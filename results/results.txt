## Interpretation of Results

### 1. **State-Level Trends**

* The analysis breaks down COVID-related search interest by state.
* **Key insights you can extract:**

  * States with the **highest search volume** likely reflect higher public concern or awareness about COVID in that region.
  * States with **low search volumes** may indicate lower concern, fewer cases, or underreporting.
  * Comparing states over time allows identification of **hotspots** and **shifts in attention** (e.g., a sudden spike in a particular state could signal a surge in cases or media coverage).

### 2. **Search Trend Patterns**

* Trends over time show **when people were most concerned** about COVID-related topics.
* **Interpretation of spikes and dips:**

  * Spikes in search trends correspond to **outbreaks, policy announcements, or media coverage**.
  * Declines in search interest may reflect **pandemic fatigue**, stabilization of cases, or shifting public focus.
* Trends can be **compared across states** to see which regions experienced concern earlier or later than others.

### 3. **Demographic Correlation**

* If combined with Census ACS data:

  * States with a **higher elderly population** might show increased search interest for health-related COVID topics.
  * Correlation with **income, poverty, or transit usage** can reveal socio-economic factors influencing public concern.

### 4. **Actionable Insights**

* **Public health monitoring:** States with sudden search spikes may require more public health messaging or intervention.
* **Policy decisions:** Identify regions where awareness is low and targeted campaigns might be needed.
* **Trend forecasting:** Early spikes in search trends can predict emerging hotspots before official case data catches up.

---

* **California:** High search volume for mask mandates and testing → indicates high public concern and active monitoring.
* **Texas:** Moderate search volume but rising trends → potential early warning for increasing cases.
* **Wyoming:** Low search volume → may reflect smaller population or less concern.
